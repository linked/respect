Proposal For Implementation Of Respect Algorithm
================================================

9/22/15 by Lee Bailey

The respect matrix algorithm as proposed is a good solution for a fair swarm-voting protocol; to some, the implementation possibilities, but to others they may not be so clear.

My proposal for one such implementation follows, with a broad goal of building a constituency voting platform that uses blockchain, respect matrix and RealID technologies to bring the democratic process into the 21st century, minimizing or eliminating two of the greatest attack vectors against American liberty today -- political corruption and voter fraud.

Political decision making should be upgraded sufficiently to more accurately invoke the will of the people, and we have the means to do so immediately.

Fixing The System
-----------------

Today, nearly all democratic process in the world is that of Representative Democracy. The problem with existing systems, without question, is the susceptibility of our representatives to coercion (misrepresentation) and the large margin for inaccuracy or outright fraud in the voting process (undesirable winner), coupled with low voter participation (small sample size). A new solution is needed, incorporating strong identity verification, a global public registry of vote actions, and methods of assigning your votes (or right to abstain) to an arbiter or politico of your choice.

I propose a system, let's call it iVote.com (for example's sake):

 - It uses the RealID initiative to allow constituents to register for a
   single Verified Citizen profile on iVote.com. Every citizen can have
   exactly one.
 - It leverages popular blockchain technology to keep a ledger of all
   Votes in a Proposal, as well as all changes and history of each
   Proposal text.
 - If you don't want to Vote on a Proposal, you can use the Respect
   Matrix to delegate your decision to someone you respect.
 - It runs at iVote.com s a nationwide software-as-a-service, or
   optionally self-hosted by any government, municipality, club, group
   or even an individual themself that wants to bring transparency to
   their proceedings.
 - It is open-source, freely licensed and belonging to humanity. APIs
   and mobile phone apps are obvious musts, as are fully public records
   of all blockchain activity.

The Adoption Problem
--------------------

Changing a government is not a quick and easy process, and if attempted directly, could be viewed as a civil unrest.

But the plight of citizens living in democratic states is very real, right now. No solution that involves years of transitioning is acceptable, change must begin to happen immediately and swiftly. So our proposal is designed to have zero need for legislative approval, no road-blocks or waiting for a revolution. There is easily, simply and appealingly a way for everyone to have their cake and eat it, too.

The first adopter of this solution should be a candidate for office -- any candidate, any office. It could even be you, it could even be me! Let's say it's you, for now -- You should model your platform like this:

 1. You will verify your identity on iVote.com. (Alternatively, Joe
    could run VoteJoe.com as a self-hosted version of the site in the
    same way instead of using iVote -- Joe would then be in charge of
    verifying identities on his own site).
 2. You will invite your citizens, constituents and peers to register
    for profiles, friend or foe.
 3. You will vow to take every Proposal facing you in your office and
    add them to the iVote.com registry, from the time they are proposed
    until the moment the vote is due.
 4. You will vow to cast your own representative vote according to the
    winner on the website as of the time of the vote.
 5. You will vow that if the experiment with your voting system goes
    well, you'll accept voting on a new Proposal: "To implement and use
    iVote for local elections"
 6. That's it, enjoy the next 1-4 years sitting in that seat purely as a
    figure-head. You'll vote how they tell you to vote. You should read
    up on the issues, but you don't have to. You can spend your time
    planning charity dinners, doing good will, and building new
    proposals and social programs -- If you do a good job, maybe they'll
    re-elect you!

Optional - Put your money where your mouth is. If you fear the new robot-voting-platform will be scary to the common voter, offer to create an escrow that'll be donated to charity if you ever break a single vow. Myself? I'd offer to swear on my literal life to uphold the promises of my office.

Sounds easy enough, right? It's a safe bet that frustrated American voters, who are also warming up to the comforts and securities of using modern technology, would be open to a new kind of Robot Politico. With a well-structured platform promising fairness, the idea can be made attractive and even hard to argue against. A successful test of the solution with a single figurehead would encourage future delegates to subscribe to the model, and eventually a quick-yet-gentle migration of both the electoral process and the electoral college to a new, truly democratic system, without changing a single rule in the current system.

The Respect Matrix And You
--------------------------

So how does the respect matrix fit into all this? It's a crucial component in ensuring the iVote platform receives adoption and doesn't suffer from low voter turnout -- just don't require voter turnout at all!

The last 20 years on the internet have bred a new understanding of social graphs, how people attribute respect, and the spread of ideas. Simply put, information travels fast, but unless someone is actively reading about a given field, modern news feeds won't keep them optimally informed and ready to make decisions.

Let's say Jeff likes cars, guns and girls -- That's fine, Jeff, good for you. But he knows he's not a rocket scientist, so he doesn't want to have to vote on rocket science issues. His childhood friend Bill really is a rocket scientist, though, and Jeff respects Bill's opinions in the field. So Jeff can give Bill 100% of his vote -- or any fraction of it!! -- and if Jeff forgets to vote on an issue because he was shooting cars and driving guns, Jeff's vote will automatically follow Bill's decision.

At the end of the day, maybe everybody has assigned their climate change votes to either Al Gore or Dick Cheney -- then, whoever has more cumulative respect in the issue will simply win the vote. Or maybe there are 100 respected scientists with slightly different plans for fixing global warming, and the people will choose the best one.

Moving Forward
--------------
I would personally love to build such a system. Running 2 businesses of my own, I cannot volunteer a full commitment, and I have made no development towards these agreeably lofty goals. I can offer guidance and advice to any team wishing to attempt a similar undertaking who likes my opinions, or I can offer to accept donations to fund my work on it, or our new fair and balanced system can simply wait until I'm able to finish it alone.

If I don't get help, if nobody assists or donates to my costs, I will consider the idea to still have merit, even without outside support. In that case, I promise to surely be the first one to run for a local office on this platform, to prove my own point and to make my best independent effort at changing a broken system.
